NAME
    Alien::SVN - A wrapper for installing the SVN Perl bindings

DESCRIPTION
    Alien::SVN is a wrapper to install the Perl bindings for subversion,
    also known as SVN::Core. If your module needs SVN::Core it can depend on
    Alien::SVN instead and then the CPAN shell can handle automatic
    installation. This is particularly useful for programs like SVK.

    It comes with a copy of Subversion 1.7.3 which it will compile but only
    installs the Perl and Subversion libraries. The subversion binaries will
    not be installed.

BUGS and FEEDBACK
    Alien::SVN only wraps SVN::Core. We don't work on it.

    Bug reports, problems and feedback about Alien::SVN and building
    SVN::Core should come to us at <bug-Alien-SVN> at <rt.cpan.org>. Or use
    the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org>.

    Issues and improvements to SVN::Core should go to the Subversion project
    directly. <http://subversion.apache.org/issue-tracker.html>

    If you're not sure who to report to, you can always report to us and
    we'll point you in the right direction.

    Report early, report often.
